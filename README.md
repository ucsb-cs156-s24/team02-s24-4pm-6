Instructions: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s24/lab/team02.html>

Deployments:

# Setup before running application

Before running the application for the first time,
you need to do the steps documented in [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

Otherwise, when you try to login for the first time, you 
will likely see an error such as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149858436-c9baa238-a4f7-4c52-b995-0ed8bee97487.png" alt="Authorization Error; Error 401: invalid_client; The OAuth client was not found." width="400"/>

# Getting Started on localhost

* Open *two separate terminal windows*  
* In the first window, start up the backend with:
  ``` 
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
* In the second window:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install  # only on first run or when dependencies change
  npm start
  ```

Then, the app should be available on <http://localhost:8080>

If it doesn't work at first, e.g. you have a blank page on  <http://localhost:8080>, give it a minute and a few page refreshes.  Sometimes it takes a moment for everything to settle in.

If you see the following on localhost, make sure that you also have the frontend code running in a separate window.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Dokku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Getting Started on Dokku

See: [/docs/dokku.md](/docs/dokku.md)

# Accessing swagger

To access the swagger API endpoints, use:

* <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>

Or add `/swagger-ui/index.html` to the URL of your dokku deployment.

# To run React Storybook

* cd into frontend
* use: npm run storybook
* This should put the storybook on http://localhost:6006
* Additional stories are added under frontend/src/stories

* For documentation on React Storybook, see: https://storybook.js.org/

# SQL Database access

On localhost:
* The SQL database is an H2 database and the data is stored in a file under `target`
* Each time you do `mvn clean` the database is completely rebuilt from scratch
* You can access the database console via a special route, <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>
* For more info, see [docs/h2-database.md](/docs/h2-database.md)

On Dokku, follow instructions for Dokku databases:
* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/postgres_database.html>
